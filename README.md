# ClojureScript Koans

This is a port of [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) for ClojureScript.

## Running the Koans

    # Compile the Clojure and ClojureScript sources
    lein compile

Open `index.html` in a browser to see which koans are done.

    # Watch the ClojureScript sources for changes and compile automatically
    lein cljsbuild auto

Now start doing the koans and refresh your browser as you go.
