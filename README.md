# ClojureScript Koans

This is a port of (Clojure Koans)[https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans] for ClojureScript.

## Running the Koans

    # Compile the Clojure and ClojureScript sources
    lein compile

Open `index.html` in a browser and check the console for which koans are done.

    # Watch the ClojureScript sources for changes and build
    lein cljsbuild auto

Now just do the koans and refresh your browser.
